        Again thanks everybody for coming. I'm still kind of new at this public speaking things and your input is
        greatly appreciated.
        Please remember to rate the presentation at the end(code camp info). Since I'm also kind of new, I like to make
        my sessions
        more of an active discussion. When I get nervous I often mis-speak so chances are I may say something wrong or in a way that's confusing. Feel free to
        stop me and ask questions at any time.

        Originally I had hoped to use direct examples from the Gr8Ladies website but as I'm writing that solo right now(yay oss?)
        I hadn't gotten as far as planned.  The main part of Gr8Ladies right now is teaching and bringing more people
        into the groovy community so that's what I hope to do here today.

    <h2>What's Groovy</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Dynamic, compiled language for the Java Virtual Machine(JVM).</li>
        <li>Interoperable with existing Java libraries</li>
        <li>Concise, easy to read code</li>
        <li>Used by many major companies including:</li>

    <aside class="notes">
        Groovy is the main focus of today’s session and the foundation of the Gr8 ecosystem of technologies.
        To start, Groovy is a dynamic compiled language for the JVM. That mean’s it’s dynamic like languages you may
        know like Python and PHP, but compiled for efficiency to run on the Java Virtual Machine aka the JVM.
        Many of you may be asking, why learn yet another programming language? And granted, Groovy is not the best
        language for every situation.
        However, in a setting where productivity is paramount and you are looking for the stability of the known
        architecture stack like Java, Groovy is the best choice.
        As you’ll see, Groovy’s easy to learn, flexible syntax and interoperability with existing Java libraries, make
        it a great language to add to your repertoire.
        It's not just a prototyping solution and many companies use Groovy for enterprise solutions including Netflix,
        LinkedIn, and Mutual of Omaha.

        Grails (the most common web framework in the Groovy eco-system and what many confuse with
        Groovy itself.)

    <h2>Groovy Architecture</h2>
    <img class="no-box" src="images/GroovyStack.jpg"/>
    <aside class="notes"/>
    You may be wondering how all of this fits together.(explain graphic)
    An important thing to note is that Groovy is compiled into
    bytecode for the JVM. Groovy is NOT compiled into Java.
    This is how groovy can be used in so many different applications. Also notice how a framework like Grails can sit on
    top of and pull in existing Java libraries and frameworks
    like Spring and Hibernate.

    <aside class="notes">
        You can do anything you can do in Java in Groovy. In fact, Almost all Java code is valid Groovy code. Groovy,
        however, usually has a way to do things with less typing than Java.
        One big thing you’ll notice is that in Groovy, you don’t always have to declare a function and then call it.
        Since Groovy is a scripting language, you can just put commands outside of any function scope and it is valid
        Groovy. Semicolons are unnecessary.

    <h2>Data Types</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Strings</li>
        <li>Collections
            <ul>
                <li>Lists</li>
                <li>Maps</li>
                <li>Ranges</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Closures</li>
        <li>Def</li>
    </ul>
    <aside class="notes">
        We will look at a few datatypes in this workshop: In addition to your normal primitives(int, bool, etc),
        there are Strings, Collections, and Closures.
        Collections include classes such as Lists and Maps. Groovy Lists correspond with Java ArrayLists and Groovy Maps
        correspond with Java HashMaps.
        Closures are pieces of functionality that you can pass around as data.

        Groovy is optionally typed. When we don’t care what type a variable is or we want mixed typing, we can use def
        instead of a data type.
        Def, short for ‘define’, roughly translates to Java Object, the base class for all other classes.
    </aside>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Strings</h2>

    <p>(examples in console)</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Single Quoted</li>
        <li>Double Quoted</li>
        <li>Multi-line</li>
    </ul>
    <aside class="notes">
        Groovy has many types of strings, but today we’ll go over the three main types: Single Quoted, Double Quoted and
        Multi-Line Strings.
        First the single quoted string is for plain text. For example, ‘Hello, World!’
        Double Quotes can be used to inject code into the text of the string. For example, “Hello, (dollar) name”. Name is a
        variable, the dollar sign tells Groovy to inject its value into the string.

        If you need a particularly long section of text, use multi-line strings by denoting three quotes followed by
        your text and ended by another three quotation marks.
        Just like before, use single quotes for plain text and double quotes if you need to embed code.

        You can manipulate Strings easily using the automatically generated String function split and the List function
        join.

        Pass a string to tokenize and it will split the String based on that as a delimiter. I heart Groovy is split on
        the spaces and the heart to create two Strings, I and Groovy.

        Pass a token to join and a list of Strings will be transformed with that token inserted as a separator. I,
        heart, and Groovy can be transformed to the single String, I heart Groovy.

        <h2>Collections</h2>
        <aside class="notes">
            Collections are groups of values like a group of numbers.
        </aside>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Lists</h2>
        <p>(examples in console)</p>
        <ul>
            <li>definition</li>
            <li>get/set value</li>
            <li>append</li>
            <li>multiply</li>
        </ul>
        <aside class="notes">
            The first and simplest type of Groovy collection is a list. Lists can have elements of different types– the
            same List can hold both Strings and integers.
            To define a list, bound your list in square brackets and separate the items with commas.

            To access elements of the list, use square brackets. Just like in Java, indices start at 0, so the index of
            the number 2 is 2, not 3.
            Here, we have changed the third element in the list to 3.

            You can easily append elements onto the end of the list using the shovel operator, which is two “less than”
            signs. To append means to add to the end.

            Collections have many available methods including basic mathematic operations plus, minus, and multiply.
            Here, I can use my list and multiply it by two. When you multiply the entire collection, it takes all of the
            elements in the list and duplicates them.
        </aside>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Maps</h2>
        <p>(examples in console)</p>
        <ul>
            <li>definition</li>
            <li>get/set by keys</li>
            <li>get all keys/values</li>
        </ul>
        <aside class="notes">
            Maps are like lists but with keys instead of numerical indices. The keys and values are separated by colons
            then separated from other pairs with commas.

            You can access the values in a Map using a dot then the keyname. This is like getting a member of a Java
            class.
            For example, we can do myMap dot val1 to get the String a. This works for both getters and setters.
            To set the value for the key val4 to 5, we can use myMap.val4 = 5.

            You can also separate out the keys and values by accessing the .values() and .keySet() methods on the map.
            Here we see the values of myMap displayed as a list.

        <h2>Ranges</h2>
        <pre><code>println (1..10)

        </code></pre>
        <pre><code>println (1..<10)
            -->[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]</code></pre>
        <aside class="notes">
            Any time you have an incremental group of numbers, you can use a range. Ranges are specified inclusively
            unless otherwise specified.

    <ul>
        <li>Flexible, familiar syntax</li>
        <li>Optional
            <ul>

        </li>
    <aside class="notes">
        In order to talk about our next data type closures, I should probably start with how functions work in general.
        Function calls look very similar to other languages. If nothing else, I hope you remember these three things
        about groovy.
        Ok it's really just one. Almost everything is optional. Parenthesis around parameters are optional. Parameters
        are optionally typed.
        and lastly... remember return statements are optional. The last statement is returned (unless the return type is
        void)

    <h2>Closures</h2>
    <p>Code as Data</p>

    <ul>
        <li>code as data</li>
        <li>definition</li>
        <li>call</li>
    </ul>
    <aside class="notes">
        Now, we’ll talk about closures. Closures are not completely unique to Groovy and other languages use similar
        concepts.
        Recently, Java 8, introduced a similar feature -- lambdas.

        By definition, closures are code as data. That means that they are pieces of functionality that can be passed
        around like variables including as a parameter to another function.

        Here is the syntax for defining and using a closure. It is like defining a variable; we start with specifying a
        type and a name.
        After the equals sign we include the body of the function in curly braces. Unlike a standard function
        definition,
        parameters are included immediately after the first curly brace and before an arrow which indicates the start of
        the body.
        Multiple parameters are separated by commas and any default parameters are indicated with an equals followed by
        the default value.

        You can call a closure by using the built-in function called “call” followed by the parameter(s).
        myClosure has two parameters, named name and year. You could have also have only one or no parameters at all.
        Typing your parameters is also optional.

        Just like with functions, return statements are optional. Unless otherwise specified, the last line of a closure
        is what's returned.

    <h2>Basic Loops</h2>
    <pre><code>
        List dl = [];
        for(int i=1; i<4; i++){
            dl.add(i * 2);
        }
        println dl;
        --> [2,4,6]
    </code></pre>
    <pre><code class="fragment">
        List dl = []
        for(i in [1,2,3]) {
        dl << i * 2
        }
        println dl
        --> [2,4,6]
    </code></pre>
    <aside class="notes">
        Basic Groovy for loops are very similar to Java for loops, but in Groovy, you can very easily iterate over a
        list of things.
        In Java, you’re restricted to iterating over a range of numbers.
        So, you would have to iterate over the indices and then index into the list of numbers that you want to double.

        In the Groovy loop, we declare the variable i to be our iterator. First we grab 2 from the list and set I equal
        to it.
        Then we double it. Then we grab 4 and set I equal to it, then 6. We could have done this same loop many ways in
        Groovy.

    <h2>Each</h2>
    <pre><code>Map m = [val1: 2, val2: 4, val3: 6]
        List dl = []
        m.each { key, value ->
            dl << value * 2
        }
        println dl
        --> [4, 8, 12]
    </code></pre>
    <aside class="notes">
        You can iterate over every item of a List or Map using the method each.
        Each is a function that takes a closure as a parameter and applies that closure to every item in the collection.
        Here we have a Map with three key-value pairs.  In our each loop we separate the key and value for each pair
        and then add only the new doubled value to our result list.  You’ll see it has the same result as our previous example.

        You can see the each function’s equivalence as a loop. Each is basically a function that performs the closure
        as the body of a for loop. Using each, we can avoid the boilerplate “for in” syntax.

    <h2>Collect</h2>
    <pre><code>
        Map m = [var1: 2, var2: 4, var3: 6]
        List dl = m.collect { name, value ->
            value * 2
        }
        println dl
        --> [4, 8, 12]
    </code></pre>
    <aside class="notes">
        In cases where we are aggregating results, we may want to use a collect statement instead of an each.
        The effect is the same except that it collects all of your results for you rather than having to
        automatically append the answer into your data structure.  Here we don’t have to initialize a new list for our
        answer myDoubledList.  We just set it equal to the result of the .collect call.
        Then, remembering that by default closures return the last executed statement, we can just leave it
        as value * 2 and the results of doubling each item from our myList is saved in myDoubledList.

<section>
    <h2>Spread Dot</h2>
    <pre><code>
        (1..3).multiply(2)
        -->[1,2,3,1,2,3]
        (1..3)*.multiply(2)
        --> [2,4,6]
    </code></pre>
    <aside class="notes">
        If you are purely dealing with lists and single functions, Groovy has another unique function that makes code even shorter.
        That function is Spread Dot.

        Continuing with our myList example, we are going to add a spread dot at the end of the variable name.
        This function takes the collection and applies the multiply function to each element of the collection individually rather than the collection as a whole.
        This means we get similar results to our each and collect loops, but completely different results than when we multiplied the list as a whole times two.

        println al
        --> [1,2,3,17]

        int answer = 0
        for (i in [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]) {
        answer += i
        }
        println answer
    </code>option2:<code class="fragment">
        int answer = 0
        (1..10).each {
            answer = answer + it

        println answer
    </code>Bonus answer:<code class="fragment">
        (1..10).sum()</code></pre>
    <aside class="notes">
        Ok. Time’s up.   Here are some of the possible solutions.

        You could have written out the list and iterated through it.

        You could have used each.

        And if you were super sly and saw us using .multiply you might have suspected there was a .sum function and used that.

    <h2>Search</h2>
    <pre><code>Map m = [val1: 2, val2: 4, val3: 6]</code></pre>
    <p>find</p>
    <pre><code>m.find{it.value % 2 == 0 && it.value % 3 != 0}
    --> val1:2</code></pre>
    <p>findAll</p>
    <pre><code>m.findAll{it.value % 2 == 0 && it.value % 3 != 0}
    --> [val1:2,val2:4]</code></pre>
    <aside class="notes">
        Find returns the first value in a collection for which the closure evaluates to true.
        FindAll returns a collection of all matching values. It is the name of the default closure parameter.
        If you don’t don’t declare any parameters, the item in the collection will be denoted by the variable named it.

        In these examples, we look for any element in the list which is divisible by 2 but not by 3.
        Find returns only the first key/value pair, and FindAll returns both pairs that fit this description.
